# Compound Assignment Operator:
    compound assignment operators are update operator. They are binary operators. They are used to update or reinitiate a new value to the variable which contain an older. 
    
    Eg. int x = 3;
            x = x +3; OR
            x += 3;

    Sytax : variable = variable + value;
                    OR
            Variable += value/expression;


# Conditional Operators : 
    It is a Ternery operator which is used for decision making purpose. The condition must be boolean type and the operand1 must be a condition. If the condition is true teh control goes to operand2. If the condition is false the control goes to operands. The result or output of a condition operator depends on the type of operand2 and operand3.

# Logical Operators :
    Logical operators are used to make logical decisions   
    1. AND operator (&&)
    2. OR operator (||)
    3. NOT operator (!)

# Increment Operator(++):
    Increment operator is unary operator which is used to update the variable with a value of 1.
    1. pre-increment operator :-
        if a variable is prefixed with increment operator is known as pre-increment operator.
        ++variable
    2. post-increment operator :- 
        if a variable is suffixed post fixed to a variable is known as post increment operator.
        variable++

# Decrement Operator(--):
    Decrement operators is unary operator which is used to update the variable with a value of 1.
    1. Pre-decrement operator :-
        if a variable is prefixed with decrement operator is known as pre-decrement operator
        --variable
    2. Post-decrement operator :-
        if a variable suffixed/ post fixed to a variable is known as post decrement operator.
        variable--
