1. Interface are the components in java which are used
    to achieve pure abstraction.
2. Interfaces are used to achieve multiple inheritance.
3. Public non static abstract methods are allowed.
4. Concrete non static methods are allowed.
5. We can create public static final variable.
6. From jdk 1.8 onwards we can also create public static methods.
7. from jdk 1.8 onwards default non-static methods are also allowed.
8. Inside an interface all the members by default are public therefore
    therefore it is not necessary for programmer to make a member public
9. All the non static methods in an interface are by default public and abstract. therefore
    it is not necessary for a programmer to a prefix.
10. If an interface consist of only on abstract method and any no of concrete static method
    is called a functional interface.
