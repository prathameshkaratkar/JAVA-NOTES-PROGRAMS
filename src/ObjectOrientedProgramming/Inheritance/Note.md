# What is Inheritance :
```
The process of one object acquiring all the properties 
and behaviours from another class is known as Inheritance.

In java we can achieve inheritance using
    (1) Extends Keywords.
    (2) Impliments Keywords.
    
(1) Extends Keywords ->
        It is used to achieve inheritance between two
        classes or two interfaces.
        
(2) Impliments Keywords ->
        It is used to achieve inheritance between an interface
        and a class.
```

### Levels of Inheritance :
```
1. Single Level Inheritance.
2. Multi Level Inheritance.
3. Hierarchical Inheritance.
4. Multiple Inheritance.
5. Hybrid Inheritance.
```

#### 1. Single Level Inheritance :
```
Inheritance achieved in one level is called single
level inheritance. (one parent and one child)

Eg... 4,5,6
```

#### 2. Multi Level Inheritance: 
```
Inheritance achieved in more than one level.

C extends B extends A

Eg... 7,8,9,10
```
