## • What is an Object ?
```
1. Objects consist of two things
    (1) Attributes / Properties.
    (2) Actions / Behaviours.
2. Attributes are used to define the object where
    as actions specify how that object is used.
3. Programmatically an object is a block of memory
    which gets created at a runtime in the heap area and represents 
    a real world object (entity) is called object in java.
4. The attributes of an object is represented by non static variables.
5. The behaviours or actions of an object are represented by non static methods.
```



## • Class :
```
1. Class is a user defined non primitive data type which represents 
    a blue print of an object.
2. In real world before creating an object. a design or a blue print is created. 
    It provides all specification of the object.
3. Eg.. Before building a house a blue print of a hosue is created.
    Before manufacturing a bike a blue print of a bike is created.
4. Same way in java before creating an object a blue print must be created. which
    gives all the specification of the object. This design cna be done with 
    the help of class.
5. With the help of class we can create objects because a class contains all the specification of an object.


• To create an object : 
    We can create an object with the help of a keyword called new (operator) and a constructor of the class.

    • New: It is keyword and operator which creates a block of memory in the heap area at the runtime.
        New operator gives the reference of the object created in  the heap area.
        
    • Constructor : It is a special member of a class whose name is same as class name.
        A constructor loads all non static members of the class into object
         
```
### • Non-Static :
```
1. The member which are not prefixed with static modifier
    are called non static members.
2. They are loaded inside object of a class.
3. They are,
    (1) Non static variables.
    (2) Non static Methods.
    (3) Non static Initializers.
```
### • Non-Primitive Data Types :
```
1. class Pen, class Book, Class Car, etc..
2. Every classname is a non primitive datatype.
3. Here Pen, Book CAr etc are non primitve data
4. With the help of non primitive data type I can create
    reference variable which can store reference of an object created.

 Default value of non primitive variable is NUll
 Eg.. Pen p1 = null;
      Book b1 = null;
```
### • Non-static Variables :
