# Encapsulation -> 
```
    It is a process of wrapping or binding the attributes
    and behaviours together is known as Encapsulation.
    
```
### Note ->
```
1. We should not give direct access to the attributes of the class object.
2. But the user should be able to read modify the attributes of class object
    only with the help of behaviours(actions)
3. Therefore it is a good practice of a programmer to design a class such that we
    can have methods to read the attributes as well as methods to update the attributes.
    
```
## Advantages: 
```
Since we provide and indirect access to the attributes,
it is secure and we can have validation steps before reading or updating
the attributes.

```
### Data Hiding :
```
It is a process of restriction direct access to the attributes of a class
(object) and providing secure and indirect access to the properties of a class
(object) is called data hiding.

```
#### Steps to achieve data hiding ->
```
1. Make the attributes private.
2. Create getter and setter methods for read and write operation resp.
3. A programmer will get the flexibility to design the follo
    (1) make attribute only readable
    (2) make attribute only modifyable but not readable
    (3) make attribute both readable and modifyable
    (4) make attribute neither readable nor modifyable.
```

## Relationships :
```
1. The association between two or more objects is known as relationships
2. There are 2 type of relationships:
    (1) Has - A relationship
    (2) Is - A relationship
```
