Q. What is a computer?
-> It is an electrinic device which is made up of Hardware and software component. It is used to save data, process data or retrieve data.

Q. What is Language?
-> It is a mode of communication

Q. What is Programming Language?
-> The language which is used to command or instruct the computer to perform specific Task is known as programming language.

# Hardware
    The combination of electronic devices which makes a computer works and listed as
    1-SSD(ROM)-(Permanent Memory)
    2-RAM(Temporary Memory)
    3-Graphic Card
    4-Processor
    5-Cooling Fan
    6-SMPS
    7-Cables
    8-Drivers

# Software
    It is a set of of programs which acts as an interface between the hardware and the user.
    Eg. Windows, Linux, Operating System.

# Levels of Programming Language:
    1-Low Level Language: The language which was direct undestandable to a computer or processor was called low level language.
        Eg. Binary Language.

    2-Assembly Level Language: The language which contained predefined set of words which was understandable to a computer with the help of an intermediate software known as Assembler.
    
    3-High Level Language: The language which was close to or similar to human language. The language which was easily, readable, modify by a programmer to the computer was called high level language. The high level language is converted to machine level language with the help of a software known as compiler or interpreter.
        Eg. C, C++, Java, Python, Perl, GoLang

# Platform:
    It is a combination of set of hardware and software components on which applications will run.
    software classified into 
    -platform dependent software :
            The software which can run on only a specific type of platform as known as platform dependent software.
    -platform independent software
            The software which are designed on a specific type of platform can run on any type of platform are known as platform independent software.


# JDK Architecture:
    JVM : 
        It is Java Virtual Machine. It is an interpreter which converts byte code to machine level language line by line. JVM is present inside JRE.
    JRE :
        It is Java Runtime Environment which is used to run Java Application. JRE consists of JVM and built in library files. JRE is present inside JDK.
    JDK :
        It is Java Development Kit. It is a package given by Oracle Community which helps us to develop as well as run the java application. JDK consists of JRE and development tools such as Java Compiler etc.


# Tokens : 
    They are the smallest unit of a programming language which are used to create instructions
    1- Keyword: compiler aware words are called as keyword. They have predefined meaning which cannot be altered by a programmer. Keywords are always return in lowercase. There are 51+ keywords
    2- Identifiers: They are name given by the programmer to the component of java such as classname, methodName, variableName, packageName, interfaceName etc.

# Literals : 
    1. Single value Data: 
        Numbers, Characters, Boolean
    2. Multi value Data
        String, Array, Class

# Type Casting
    Windening and Narrowing and also Upcasting and Downcasting

# Operators and their Types
    Logical, Bitwise, Assignment, Comparative, Compunding, Arithmetic 

# Control Statement and Looping With Examples
    If, Else if and Else statement
    Looping : for loop
             Do while loop
             While loop
             Switch Case


# Methods :-
    1. Code Modularity.
    2. Advantages of methods
    3. Terminologies
    4. Methods are classified into two based on formal arguments
    5. Characteristics
    6. Working of Main methods
    7. Return
    8. Method Binding Process
    9. Method Overloading
    10. Static  -> static method, static block and static initializers
